A brief Introduction
=====================

A SHORT COURSE IN COMPUTATIONAL-CORPUS LINGUISTICS – using the R library text2vec – with a focus on working with (a controlled vocabulary of) multi-word expressions. Here we consider a Twitter corpus comprised of all tweets generated by the 535 voting members of the US Congress during the second session of the 116th Congress.

More specifically, we consider the usage of COVID19-related terms as a function of both time and party affiliation; we also investigate the conceptual relatedness of COVID19-relevant terms using a GloVe model and multi-dimensional scaling.

A cache of scalable & efficient methodologies for some common corpus-based tasks.
